# Introduction
This is the code of the article "A clarity and fairness aware framework for selecting workers in competitive crowdsourcing tasks".

#Progress
We used the Stack Overflow dataset that you can download from this link[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q33zXpglbViJtDEJYP0oAuH-r24wkWKU?usp=sharing]
To use this code for your purpose and dataset, you should follow and run files based on their number. As you can see the name of each folder starts by a number. You should follow from the first file, 1_prepration, to the last one, 13_charts. In each folder, if the order is important, you find the same pattern, otherwise, you can run files without any order.
